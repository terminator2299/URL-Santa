# URL-Santa
**Description:**   *A Python script that plays Santa for your URLs, checking each one and delivering their status—whether they're valid, redirecting, missing, or on the naughty list (uncheckable or error-prone). Perfect for those who want a quick way to validate links without any hassle. 🎅🎁*
